After upgrading my Plus One to Android 5.0 and 5.1 XPrivacy stopped working.
The Xposed Installer gave these messages:

> Error message: xposed not yet compatible with SDK 22 or your processor architecture (armeabi-v7a)

> Cannot link executable dependencies: Library "libdvm.so" not found.

## The New Art

Android 5 changed the virtual machine from [Dalvik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_%28software%29) to [Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Runtime). XPosed was originally written for Dalvik and incompatible with Art.
